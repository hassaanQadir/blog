# Getting to my Summer 2023 Internship
Here's an outline of how I ended up interning at Avalo in the Summer of 2023.

## The summer prior
In Summer 2022, I did iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) wet-lab research, where we made recombinant E. coli that could produce equol, a molecule which can mimic estrogen in the body. The work was super interesting and I learned a lot over the months of research, and I had a great time with the team and presenting at conferences, but at the end of the day, I was pretty sure I never wanted to do wet-lab research ever again. Sitting at a desk pipetting back and forth, only to find out a week later that something went wrong and the experiment would have to be redone--not fun. So, while I still love biotech and synthetic biology, I want to go more into CS, bioinformatics, software engineering, etc. 

## Grinding emails
Unfortunately I made the classic mistake of procrastinating and instead of immediately searching for summer 2023 internships in the summer of 2022, I waited until winter break, by which point nearly all large formalized software internships were well-past the resume stage.

It was time to grind, so I went to biopharmguy and got a list of about 75 biotech companies, mainly startups but also some larger ones, and started emailing them all. A bunch had open internship applications, which I also completed.

I eventually contacted 89 companies, with 74 ghostings, 11 rejections, and three offers. That's about a 5% conversion rate, not too bad honestly, considering the lateness of my attempts.

## Choosing an offer
The three offers were between a wet-lab position at Pivot.bio, and two vague, mainly computational positions at Reshape Biotech, a Danish lab automation startup, and at Avalo.ai, a North Carolina Research Triangle ML-genomics startup. 

My main desire was to work in Boston or San Francisco, but that didn't pan out, so I then was just looking for a place where I could do the most interesting work and get to know some cool people to learn from by osmosis. I pursued each of these opportunities concurrently until I made a final decision and received a signed contract.

That was very smart of me, because my first pick choice, Reshape Biotech, ended up withdrawing the offer a couple months after they had verbally agreed to it. Fortunately I had kept the other two open, so then I went with Avalo. Reshape had been my first choice mainly because Denmark sounded more cool than North Carolina, but Avalo's tech was really interesting so I was still pretty happy going there. 

However, they then told me it'd be a part-time, 20hrs a week position, which I really did not want. Yet my only other option was the dreaded wet-lab at Pivot.bio, so I took Avalo. The part-time nature of the work has turned out be a major blessing in disguise.
