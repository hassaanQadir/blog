# Grinding for a Summer 2024 Internship
I want to get a good software engineering internship next year, with the aim of a return offer after that. My priority is to find a position that'll give me credibility for the future, expose me to new developments in the industry, and net me a good income.

## The outline

## What am I actually doing
That's what I should be doing. In terms of what I'm actually doing, I'm about a week behind on leetcode, but the projects and applications are going well overall. I also need to grind and get referrals.

## Considerations of the future
Going into more detail, what would my ideal 2024 internship look like? Let's be honest here:

1. Hard to get into
2. San Francisco Bay Area
3. Friendly colleagues
4. Cool technology
5. High income

The FAANGMULA etc are definitely high up on the list. Then unicorns and interesting startups. There are definitely a number of companies that would be greast but wouldn't take me. That being said, I'll do my best and say Bismillah when I shoot my shot.
