## [Myself](#myself)

### Intro

I’m Hassaan Qadir, and I want to go into software & biotech! I’ve decided to focus on software skills over biology domain knowledge, so I aim to go into software engineering directly out of undergrad. There’s a lot of information on securing useful SWE internships, so I wrote this to help me, and maybe you too!

### About Me

I’m a rising junior CS major at Yale with a 3.80 GPA. 

In terms of work experience, I spent my first summer (2022) doing primarily wet-lab research for the Yale International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team, although I did some computational stuff, too. In my second summer (2023), I was/am a Computational Biology Intern at Avalo, helping engineer their bioinformatics pipeline and analyzing a bunch (hundreds) of rice genomes they need to work with.

In terms of projects, I made [onlinechargemaster.com](https://www.onlinechargemaster.com/). This website goes through a bunch (hundreds) of .CSVs provided by California and uses that to create a dashboard where users can input a location & search for a medical procedure and receive a list of hospitals near them, ranked by price. [Github link](https://github.com/hassaanQadir/chargemaster).

I also made the [Pandemic Patient Prognosis](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Yarrow_Software.covid_19prognosisapp) app on Google Play Store, which will take the user’s underlying conditions and output a COVID-19 mortality risk based on early 2020 data. I made this before I understood Github.

Most recently, I made [molbio.ai](molbio.ai), a multi-LLM Agent which takes in a bio research project, e.g. “Create E. coli which makes insulin,” divides it into discrete experiments, and programs a lab robot to perform all of the experiments. [Github link](https://github.com/hassaanQadir/molbio-ai).

I’ve been doing some leetcode here and there, and am an above-median student in my classes, although I’m easily distracted by my extracurricular pursuits. This summer 2023, I’ll be grinding inshallah.

## [Outline](#outline)

I made this outline of the process largely by digesting the [Tech Interview Handbook](techinterviewhandbook.org). Super great website, but it can get overwhelming, so this outline is essential for me.
