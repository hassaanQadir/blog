# Work at Avalo Inc

## Starting at Avalo
Everything started out really well (and also continued well fyi). I was met on the first day by one of the co-founders, Mariano, who was super nice and interesting. I was really impressed by how enthusiastic and dedicated everyone seemed about the work, and it only strengthened my aspiration to one day found a biotech startup and work on a cool project with a team of hard-working gigachads.

From Day One, I was learning very very much. AWS, Docker, bioinformatics, Bash wizardry, machine learning, rice genetics, all on the first day. For the first week, Mariano would give me rides to and fro and I always enjoyed our conversations.

## My routine at Avalo
Now that I'm a few weeks in, I have a good routine set up. My direct lead is Dr. Emily Bellis, who's big on computational population genetics. She, like everyone at Avalo, has been really friendly and she's a great person to work under. I mainly work on building portions of the bioinformatics pipeline that she describes to me. These mini-projects generally take about ten hours to complete and I always learn a lot, often it's 8 hours of learning and experimenting and ChatGPTing and then 2 hours of implementation.

The schedule is very chill, people can work from home or show up in the office whenever. This is actually a bit of a downside for me as I'm really bad at waking up early in the morning unless I have a metaphorical gun to my head. My schedule's been shifting from 9-5ish to 10-6ish to 11-6ish; not good. Inshallah I'll get back on the grind and be a normal functional human adult--I'll wake up for Fajr right before sunrise at 5:45 AM and stay up from there. An hour before 9 is worth two after 5.

## Goals for Avalo
I don't interact with Mariano as much anymore, he and Brendan, the other co-founder, are often in meeting with potential partners and investors. But I did meet with him to discuss how things were going and to discuss my goals, which were threefold.

1. Write great documentation
2. Comprehend the bioinformatics pipeline
3. Do well enough to warrant getting a full-time offer from Avalo
